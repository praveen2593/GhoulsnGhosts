# GhoulsnGhosts
Multiclass Problem - Classification of Ghouls and Ghosts


## Synopsis

This project and code is aimed at performing EDA to understand different features and applying various Machine Learning models to classify a given set of data. The dataset was obtained directly from Kaggle(link provided in the contribution)


## Code Example

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.


## Motivation

The dataset enables application of multiple Machine Learning models, and allows to understand different parameters involved in fine tuning each model.


## Installation

Download the code and the dataset. Make sure that path for the dataset is modified in the code.
